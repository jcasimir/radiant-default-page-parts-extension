= Default Page Parts

This extension is a complete hack. It depends heavily upon the default page creation behavior of the Page class in Radiant > 0.6.9. It overrides Page.new_with_defaults to look for the file parts.yml in the root extension directory (i.e. vendor/extensions/default_page_parts/parts.yml) that should contain a YAML formatted list of page parts to create in the new child page.

*Important*: The configuration file parts.yml must contain at least one part (most likely named "body") or no page parts will be created.

If the file parts.yml doesn't exist the old "new_with_defaults" method will be called and will use the defaults set in Radiant::Config['defaults.page.parts'].  So if you wish to return to the old behavior simply remove parts.yml or rename it.

So it's a hack, but a useful one. Since this extension monkeypatches the singleton class of class Page, it applies to your pages globally and does not depend upon the page type. 

= How to use it

Let's say you want all pages to have a default comments part.  Simply edit or add to parts.yml thusly:

---
- name: body
  filter: textile
- name: comments
  filter: textile
  content: "<r:snippet name='comments'/>" # or whatever you want the comments part to contain 

Now save the file and restart your server. Now when you add children to the any page, the child will automagically have a "comments" page part which will include the text "<r:snippet name='comments'/>" by default.

Note: You cannot currently confine the default parts to only children of a particular page.  This may change in the future.

TODO:
1.) Testing
2.) Allow default parts for only children of a particular page.
